rices that keep me alive somehow

lit rally this is just a repo for the rices i have seen and tried and just love. i have autism+adhd, which means i have really spefici tastes yet i get bored sUper easily. this is my way to keep a nice collection of the stuff that makes me feel better when staring at my computer for hours while working on my dissertation.
i'll try to add my own screenshots next to the originals as i use the dotfiles myself. anyways. drink water, eat a fruit, watch some anitok. peace!
