# rice for the wise
or:
**rices that keep me alive *somehow***

lit rally this is just a repo for the rices i have seen and tried and just **love**. 
i have autism+adhd, which means i have really specific tastes *yet* i get bored sUper easily.
this is my way to keep a nice collection of the stuff that makes me feel better when staring at my computer for hours while working on my dissertation.

i'll try to add my own screenshots next to the originals as i use the dotfiles myself. anyways: drink some water, eat a fruit, stretch a little and watch some ani-tok. peace!
