# rice for the wise
or:
**rices that keep me alive *somehow***

lit rally this is just a repo for the rices i have seen and tried and just **love**. 
i have autism+adhd, which means i have really specific tastes *yet* i get bored sUper easily.
this is my way to keep a nice collection of the stuff that makes me feel better when staring at my computer for hours while working on my dissertation.

i'll try to add my own screenshots next to the originals as i use the dotfiles myself. anyways: drink some water, eat a fruit, stretch a litte and watch some ani-tok. peace!

  ## some advice from ur fav dumbass
<kbd> ｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈•ﾟ｡</kbd>
<details>
  <summary>why so many desktops???? </summary>
  
>because i can and i get bored *easily*. also, why not take advantage of the wonderful flexibility of the most awesome operating system?
  
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary>how do i make it work? </summary>
  
>  **THIS** was the thing that made me *mess up* and get *really* frustrated as a begginer. i tried to apply ***different*** configs for ***different*** desktop enviroments **(DE)** on **one single user**, and it `broke stuff.`   
  the solution? **having different user for each DE or rice you are using**. it can be a little bit excesive to have four different users, but it's actually really easy and not hard at all.  
  now, this is my method, *but everyone have their own tweaks and preferences*, so feel free to mix and match!
  
1. so, you installed [`something`] (in my case, Manjaro) and you have a new user. **This is your default user**. You can rice it, of course, but in my case, i will only do a **light** rice in my default DE/WM.  
	- i chose my base username as `apolito`, and my default DE is `XFCE`, which means i have a *barely customized* xfce desktop that works as a startpoint  
	- as a noob myself, when ricing and learning linux **u will mess up**, and it's really helpful to have an enviroment and an user you can comeback to in case something breaks. so, bare with me.  
		
2. you have your backup, your comfort zone. however, you are a brave adventurous bean who wants to try and learn. let's say you start with something friendly: **Openbox**. what do you do? easy, you create a new user that is `your default username` + `a letter that matches the new desktop`  
	- i'll admit it: it is getting messy. let me give you an example.  
	so my *default* user is `apolito`, and i wanna try openbox. so what do i do? create a new user named `apolitop`; that is *apolito* + <kbd>p</kbd>
	
3. why not create an alternate and more different username? easy: i'm ✨dumb✨. i **will** forget i was using *potatopotato* for openbox and try to start a session in bspwm and panic. so, by just adding 1-2 letters to my "official" username i can easily identify what DE im using with that specific user, and avoid dumb headaches.  
	- more examples!  
	<kbd>apolitox</kbd> -> `xmonad`  
	<kbd>apolitob</kbd> -> `bspwm`  
	<kbd>apolitoi</kbd> -> `i-3 gaps`,  
	and so on.

<summary>and what about the files?</summary>
  
> i usually have two main storages: my external hardrive and different accounts on the cloud. that is, i barely have anything important in my computer hardrive, since i usually just download or open the files i need to use at the moment. the only thing i have "physically" inside the drive is my music, and when i change from one user to other, i just move the music to the current one.  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>how do i even start??? </summary>
  
> trial and error, curiosity, and **READ THE FREAKING** README'S.  
jokes aside, most of the dotfiles u can find in places like [/r/unixporn](www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) will also have amazing, really useful readme's and wikis that can help you set up the dotfiles and make sure everything works perfectly fine. most of the times i broke something, was because i was too lazy to read. just do it. it will save you so much time!

> secondly, there are wonderful forums on reddit and hundreds of youtube channels that will guide you in order of how to use linux, install and setup software (even dotfiles), and anything you need to know. i promise, most of the time, you will find a guide or video if you google whatever you are looking for.
