literally this was my first dotfile install when i changed to arch from windows. just love it: familiar enough for a newbie, yet also flowing with practicallity and beauty

just one of the most amazing rices overall that i have ever seen. comes with a install script and have every need cover-- even dynamic light/dark themes!

one of the almost non existent light schemes that i can use-- it was bit hard for me to set it up the first times, but it's worthy. wonderful aesthetic!
